-- V032__create_stock_transfers_table.sql
-- Story 2.9: Stock Transfer Between Locations
-- Creates table for tracking stock transfers between locations

-- TODO: Migration temporarily disabled - duplicate of V019
-- The stock_transfers table was already created in V019__create_stock_transfers_tables.sql
-- This migration attempts to create the same table and indexes again, causing conflicts.
-- Need to either:
--   1. Remove V032 completely, OR
--   2. Merge unique content from V032 into V019
--
-- This migration should be reviewed and either merged or removed.

-- Placeholder to allow migration to complete
